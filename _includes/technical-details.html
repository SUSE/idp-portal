  The new system is a Univention Corporate Server setup running in our Nuremberg data center. It is an open source solution based on a Debian system (maybe we can collaborate to also have it running on SLES in the future). The development is done openly on github: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/univention">github.com/univention</a>.
